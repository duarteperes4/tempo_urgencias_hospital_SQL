# Hospital Emergency Waiting Time Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital emergency room waiting times using SQL to identify peak hours, bottlenecks, and performance patterns.

The objective was to simulate a Business Intelligence scenario where raw healthcare data is transformed into actionable insights using structured queries.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- SQL
  - SELECT statements
  - JOINs
  - GROUP BY
  - Aggregations (AVG, COUNT)
  - Filtering (WHERE clauses)

---

## 📂 Process

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Queried the dataset to understand structure and key variables
- Identified relevant fields (date, time, waiting duration, category)

### 2️⃣ Data Aggregation
- Calculated average waiting times
- Grouped results by time periods (hours/days)
- Counted number of admissions per period

### 3️⃣ Performance Analysis
- Identified peak hours with higher waiting times
- Compared demand across different time intervals
- Highlighted possible service bottlenecks

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain hours show significantly higher average waiting times
- Demand fluctuates depending on time of day
- Results suggest potential improvements in resource allocation

---

## 🎯 BI Relevance
This project demonstrates:
- Strong SQL querying skills
- Data aggregation and KPI calculation
- Analytical thinking
- Ability to transform raw data into structured insights
